# FRAGGEN METHOD EVALAUTION
This repository is a updated version of the scripts provided in FRAGGEN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1813) method evaluations.

Folder description:<br>

- RQ1 : Evaluate the near duplicate detection task. WE used the provided combindEntries.json and TSE_Fraggen.py (with modification for refining data) for evaluation. Therefore, we only considered evaluation FRAGGEN as a baseline for the setting of with-in app, because mrbs app is not included in their near duplicate study. In within app, we take the average f1 score across 8 apps.
